# Getting Started

First, I'd recommend referencing the [cheat sheet](#) and making flash cards for the commands to go accompany you.

##### Navigation

Let's begin! Where are we? Seriously, where are we!?!? 

A very helpful command that I use often is `pwd` present working directory. Which shows your where you currently are.

You're most like sitting in the user file that you logged into:

/Users/_whateveryounamedyourmac_

Now that we have a sense of where we're at, let's look around!

We can use `ls` to list all of the directories available within this path

> find a directory in which you'd like to explore and we'll move on,

Great, now that we know where we are, let's do some exploring! ...baby steps though! 

We can jump between Directories or 'Folders' with the command `cd` for change directory

Let's try it out, let's explore that directory!

`cd directory` if your directory is not a single word, you'll need quotation marks, i.e. `cd "Let's Explore"

Don't worry about getting trapped in a directory, you can easily navigate back with `cd ..` 

To navigate back multiple directories in a single line, use `cd ../../../..` for however far you wish to go.

##### Create

Wasn't that great!? but we can't settle on just exploring these directories, let's create our own adventure!

Let's dive right in and create a new directory

type `mkdir name` and do a quick `pwd` to make sure your new directory has been created

Nice Work!
